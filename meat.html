      <h1>The Impacts of Meat</h1>

      <h2>It takes a lot of resources to make meat.</h2>
      <p>Land for grazing, fields and fields of grains, and lots of water.

      </p>
      <p>Adding to the problem is that more and more people are consuming meat. This is because more people can afford it. Since the demand is increasing, it's putting a strain on our natural resources. Natural resources that could be used to grow more efficient and sustainable foods made from plants.

      <p>As a meat-lover in an Asian household, it's hard not to have meat at every meal. However, there have been advances in alternative meat choices that make it much easier than it was before to try eating less meat. Some examples of companies that pioneered the way are <a href="https://www.ju.st/products/just-egg" alt="link to just egg website">JUST Egg</a>, <a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/food" alt="link to impossible foods website">Impossible Foods</a>, and <a href="https://www.incogmeato.com/en_US/products.html" alt="link to incogmeato website">Incogmeato</a>. They have found clever ways to serve up surprisingly similar "meats" using plant proteins. I have yet to try it myself, but it looks delicious.</p>
