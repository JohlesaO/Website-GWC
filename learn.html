      Eating Mindfully strives to educate people about their food so that they can be more mindful and responsible consumers.</h2>
        <p>
          Understand the work that goes into food, the environmental impacts of food choices, and learn how you can support a healthier planet.

      <h2>Why care?</h2>
      <p>
      <b>The environment.</b> As of 2021, the Pacific Northwest suffered a massive heat-wave. Floods torment Belgium and China. Global warming is making severe weather conditions worse, and if we don't do something to cut greenhouse gas emissions, we'll be seeing a lot more disasters. There's a whole lot of other issues: <b>Sustainability, Animal rights, and Farmerâ€™s rights.</b>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/ghg_report/ghg_nitrous.php" alt="link to eia article">eia</a>, "The largest source [of nitrous oxide pollution] is agriculture (73 percent), and the majority of agricultural emissions result from nitrogen fertilization of agricultural soils (87 percent of the agriculture total) and management of animal waste (13 percent)."

      <h2>Main problem</h2>
      
      <p>Demand for meat is rising, which means more land-clearing, more greenhouse gas emissions, and great risk for health problems. Additionally, conventional farming methods are causing more harm than good to the environment, and supporting more organic farming can mitigate those adverse effects.</p>
      <h2>Who is impacted?</h2>
      <p>Consumers, Farmers/Ranchers, and Animals.

      </p>
      <h2>What can we do to solve this?</h2>
      <p>Try your hand at alternative meats! You don't have to stop eating meat. You just have to eat less of it. Even just eating less meat for one day can have a dramatic impact on reducing your carbon footprint. And, support local or organic when you can! It supports local farmers, and you can help to cut carbon emissions. It takes less fuel to transport something local compared to something flown and trucked-in from way across the country.
