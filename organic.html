      <h1>Organic Farming</h1>

      <p class="essay">
        8.5.2021 by Johlesa Orm

        <br></br>
        <br>There aren't a lot of organic farmers in the US.</br>
      <br>And you can probably tell. At the produce section in the grocery store, most of what you'll see are waxed apples, enormous peaches, and juicy, ruby-like strawberries, all in pristine condition. Everything is big, big, big.</br>
      <br>This level of perfection is achieved with the help of fertilizers and pesticides. And with that perfection comes rising standards for how produce should look and taste from consumers. Almost the entire supermarket produce section is a product of conventional farming. Organic products, on the other hand, are virtually nonexistent.</br>
      
      <br>Part of the reason why organic products are virtually nonexistent is because here are so many obstacles surrounding organic farming. For one, itâ€™s a lot harder to grow organic because farmers have to battle many more weeds and pests without the help of artificial fertilizers. If you have a home garden, you get it. How did that tomato that looked just fine yesterday have a hole in it now?? With organic, it's hard not to get to every single weed or pest, and that hinders the yield and size of produce. And, as if the obstacles on the farm weren't enough, farmers also face the obstacles on the shelves at the grocery stores. Because of all that hard work and maitenance, organic produce is more expensive. Price, unfortunately, determines a lot of people's choices. People would rather buy non-organic, prettier, cheaper produce even if it means risking damage to the environment or their health. Sure, it's good for the planet, but not by that much, right? Plus, it's more expensive and it just doesn't look as good. I'll just go with the regular one.</br>

      </br>
      <br>But organic does make a difference, no matter how small. Organic farmers take huge risks in order to preserve soil quality and reduce pollution in our soil and waterways. And this is with the fact that their produce might not even make it past the shelves. Since there aren't that many organic farmers, their farming methods and pest control methods are also relatively new, but growing. It takes patience, bravery, and resilience to grow this way, and that makes their produce so amazing. More companies are supporting organic farmers, such as <a href="https://www.annies.com/" alt="link to annie's main website">Annie's</a>.</br>
      <br>These farmers are doing something good for the environment, and a lot of their predicaments could be alleviated through our choice at the supermarket. We have the power to reconsider our perception of organics. We have the power over someone's wage and whether their families get to eat or not. We have the power to change our health and the planet.</br></p>
